Day 2 of IoT project 

## 🚦 Traffic Signal using ESP32

### Description
This project demonstrates a simple traffic signal using three LEDs with BUZZUR.

### Simulation (Wokwi)
▶️ Run the simulation here:https://wokwi.com/projects/455645756306643969..or Arduino IDE....

## 🔧 Components Used
- ESP32
- 3 LEDs
- Buzzer
- Resistors
- Breadboard

## ⚙️ Pin Configuration
-LED (1,2,3):long leg connect GPI pin with 220(ohm) resistor short leg GND
-buzzer:long leg connect GPI pin short leg GND 

## 🧠 Working
- LED1 turns ON for 1 second
- LED2 turns ON for 1 second
- LED3 turns ON for 3 seconds
- Buzzer turns ON after LED3
